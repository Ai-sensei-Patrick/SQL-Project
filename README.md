# SQL-Project

This assignment is to calculate a bushfire risk score with regard to bushfire protection
for different neighbourhoods in Sydney. The neighbourhood ’score’ is expressed as a measure
of several factors which we assume to affect the risk of bush fires within an area vegetation,
population density, number of dwellings etc.

In this project, we integrate different type of data from csv data, geo spatial data, json data and data from a website. We did also did some simple correlation analysis between fire risk score correlate to the region median household income and the rental prices of the region. Please read "DATA2001 REPORT.pdf" file for the full report.

We did SQL via jupyter notebook, with Jupyter notebook we could did better data management using SQL and complex analysis with libraries that Python provide.
